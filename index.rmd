## R Markdown Intro

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

I can write code in line `L <- solve(diag(nrow(A)) - A)` [see @Bruckner:2012] or in a code block like below. 

$L = (I - A)^{-1}$  

[@Bruckner:2012; @Wieland:2017]

```{r stats}
str(cars)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
